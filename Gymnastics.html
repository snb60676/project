    <p> <big> Gymnast also have to achieve certain requirements to move on to the next level. Although it is quite normal for gymnast to repeat levels 
       it is also normal for some very talented gymnast to test out of levels and never actually compete that level because they were to good for it. 
       </big> </p>
   <p> <big> Once a gymnast who is very serious about gymnastics reaches age 10-12 they have to decide if they want to go Elite or go to college route. 
      Choosing to go elite will make them focus on training for the Olympics and/or move away to train at more advanced training facilities. 
      The United States right now has one of the most amazing gymnast we have ever seen.</big> </p>

         <h2> Simone Biles </h2>
              <p class="double">
            Simone Biles can easily be recognized as the best Gymnast in American History. She started Gymnastics at age 6 and hasnt stopped since.
            At the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio(her first apperence in the Olympics) she set an American record for the most gold medals in women's gymnastics
            at a single games. She also equally matched many other different records with her medals won in Rio. She also became the 6th female gymnast in history 
            to win an individual gold medal in the World Championship and the Olympic Games. She and another teammate Gabby Douglas are the only American females
            to win both the individual all-around gold medal and team gold medal in the same Olympic games. Simone, now 21 years old, again winning all four events at the 
            World Cahmpionship this year is preparing to head back to the Olympics in 2020 where her goal and only true competition is to beat herself.
